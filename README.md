# Shared Micromobility Data Explorer

This repo hosts code for mapping and visualizing shared micromobility data origins and destinations using Mapbox GL JS.

## Getting Started

1.  `npm install`

1.  `npm start`

1.  Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

## Getting Data

In order to pull data into the map when you run this code locally on your computer, you have two options:

1.  Download the [dockless-api](https://github.com/cityofaustin/dockless-api) repo and follow the instructions to set it up locally on your machine.
    - If you install the dockless-api using Docker, you should be able to pull data without further configuration.
    - If you run the dockless-api using the Python local install, you will need to change the `API_URL` value in the `webpack.dev.js` file:
      - from: `API_URL: JSON.stringify("http://localhost:8000/v1/trips")`
      - to: `API_URL: JSON.stringify("http://localhost:80/v1/trips")`
2.  Pull data from the production API:
    - In order to reference the production API endpoint, you will need to change the `API_URL` value in the `webpack.dev.js` file:
      - from: `API_URL: JSON.stringify("http://localhost:8000/v1/trips")`
      - to: `API_URL: JSON.stringify("https://dockless-data.austintexas.io/v1/trips")`
